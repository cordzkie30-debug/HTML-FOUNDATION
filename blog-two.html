        <h1>Understanding JavaScript</h1>
        <p>By <strong>Ray John Cordero</strong></p>
      </header>
      <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>JavaScript</strong> often abbreviated as <strong>JS</strong>, is
        a programming language and core technology of the World Wide Web,
        alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client
        side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.
        All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the
        code on users' devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>JavaScript</strong> is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled
        language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic
        typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
        It is multi paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and
        imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces
        (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data
        structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>ECMAScript standard</strong> does not include any
        input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities.
        In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript
        APIs for I/O.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are
        now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The
        most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective
        standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in
        design.
      </p>
      <h3>Website Client-side Usage</h3>
      <p>
        JavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web,
        with 99% of all websites using it for this purpose.[10] Scripts are
        embedded in or included from HTML documents and interact with the DOM.
      </p>
      <p>
        All major web browsers have a built-in JavaScript engine that executes
        the code on the user's device.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <p>Examples of Scripted Behavior</p>
        <li>
          Loading new web page content without reloading the page, via Ajax or a
          WebSocket. For example, users of social media can send and receive
          messages without leaving the current page.
        </li>
        <li>
          Web page animations, such as fading objects in and out, resizing, and
          moving them.
        </li>
        <li>Playing browser games.</li>
        <li>Controlling the playback of streaming media.</li>
        <li>Generating pop-up ads or alert boxes.</li>
        <li>
          Validating input values of a web form before the data is sent to a web
          server.
        </li>
        <li>
          Logging data about the user's behavior then sending it to a server.
          The website owner can use this data for analytics, ad tracking, and
          personalization.
        </li>
        <li>Redirecting a user to another page.</li>
        <li>
          Storing and retrieving data on the user's device, via the storage or
          IndexedDB standards.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <p>Core Characteristics</p>
        <li>
          <strong>Dynamically Typed:</strong> Variable types are determined at
          runtime rather than at compile time, allowing a single variable to
          hold different data types over its lifecycle.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Event-Driven:</strong> It is designed to respond to user
          interactions, such as mouse clicks, keyboard inputs, or page scrolls.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Single-Threaded with Asynchrony:</strong> JavaScript executes
          one task at a time but uses an "event loop" and features like Promises
          and async/await to handle time-consuming operations (like fetching
          data) without freezing the user interface.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Prototypal Inheritance:</strong> Unlike strictly class-based
          languages, JavaScript objects inherit directly from other objects
          through a prototype chain, though modern "class" syntax acts as a
          familiar wrapper.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        By doing a lot of practice, you will definitely experience errorsand
        bugs in your code, but dont worry, you will overcome them all!
      </p>
      <h4>Common Misconception</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>JavaScript</strong> is not <strong>Java</strong>. Despite the similar names, they are entirely
        different languages with distinct designs, syntax, and execution
        environments. Java is a compiled, class-based language, while JavaScript
        is an interpreted (or JIT-compiled) scripting language.

      <p>By doing a lot of practice, you will definitely experience errorsand bugs in your code, but dont worry, you will overcome them all!</p>
